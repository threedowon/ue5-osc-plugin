Custom OSC Plugin for Unreal Engine  
This plugin extends the functionality of the built-in **OSC (Open Sound Control)** and provides additional features for interactive media art, networking, and sensor integration.

## Features
- Built on top of Unreal's official **OSC (Open Sound Control)**
- Provides simplified Blueprint nodes for sending/receiving OSC messages
- Easy integration with external devices and applications
- Fully compatible with **Blueprints**

## System Requirements
- Unreal Engine **5.3+** (tested on 5.3 / 5.4)
- Built-in **OSC Engine Plugin**

⚠️ You don’t need to enable OSC manually.  
When you enable **OSC Plugin**, Unreal will automatically enable the built-in **OSC (Open Sound Control)**.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/3dowon/ue5-osc-plugin/releases) page.  
2. Extract the downloaded archive and place the folder into your project’s **Plugins/** directory.  
   - If the `Plugins` folder does not exist, create one manually.  
3. Open your Unreal Engine project. The plugin will be automatically detected.
